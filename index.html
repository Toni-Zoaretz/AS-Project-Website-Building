      <h1>The Benefits of Having a Healthy Relationship with Chocolate</h1>
      <p>
        if you’d characterize your relationship with chocolate as “complicated,”
        you’re not alone. About 45 percent of women in the U.S. report that they
        have chocolate cravings, with a whopping 91 percent of female college
        students reporting regular cravings for it. Research shows that, unlike
        men, many women have feelings of guilt when eating this potentially
        “forbidden” food, or they fight the urge to eat it at all. This strained
        relationship with chocolate can be harmful in a number of ways.
        Nutrition experts explain how making up with chocolate can benefit not
        only your taste buds, but also your health.

      <h1>Dark Chocolate</h1>
      <p>
        Dark chocolate contains powerful antioxidants. Among the most beneficial
        is a flavonol called epicatechin. Flavonols are compounds found in
        plants that fight inflammation and protect against cell damage caused by
        free radicals.

          Increases heart health: The antioxidants in dark chocolate have been
          shown to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of clotting and
          increase blood circulation to the heart, lowering the risks of stroke,
          coronary heart disease and death from heart disease.

          Balances the immune system: Flavonols prevent the immune system from
          going into overdrive and reduce oxidative stress, which is an
          imbalance caused by cells fighting against free radicals and a common
          cause of many diseases.

          Flavonols in dark chocolate have a positive impact on brain function,
          including better reaction time, visual-spatial awareness and stronger
          memory. Though research is ongoing, one reason for this may be that
          flavonols increase blood flow to the brain.
